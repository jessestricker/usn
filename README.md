## Introduction

The _Unicode Syntax Notation_ is a descriptive language that can be used
to define the rules of any context-free language.

It is similar in style to the well-known
[Backus-Naur form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form),
adding it's own set of improvements in usefullness and correctness.

Some of it's more distinctive features are:

- Define charachter properties using Unicode
- Notations inspired from regular expresseions
- Use operations from set theory on character classes
